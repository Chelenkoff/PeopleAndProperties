# PeopleAndProperties

PeopleAndProperties is a C++ based small project, demonstrating the basic OO design principles.
  - Class declaration / Object instantiation
  - Constructors/Destructors definition
  - Setters/Getters definition
  - Operator overloading
  - Collections 
  - etc...
  
### Task
Define a base class for Person with given name, personal identification number and address. Create another custom class, consisting an array of pointers to the addresses of owned properties of each person (char *adr[n], n<=5). The classes should have proper constructors, desctructors and member functions. Create the following functionality:
  - Print info of people whose address matches one of their owned properties
  - Print info of owned properties by given Personal Identification Number (EGN)
  - Overload '<<' operator in a way that it prints out the information properly
  - Save data to a file
